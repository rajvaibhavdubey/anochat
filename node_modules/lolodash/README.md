# lolodash<sub>__</sub>
Inspired by Scala's `Try` classes (including `Success` and `Failure`).

# Go lolodash<sub>__</sub> or go nono
By using `lolodash` you can avoid most try-catch blocks in your code. That is because `lolodash` wraps around possible exceptions and simply returns whether it succeeded or failed.

Don't get it? Here is an example that will always succeed:
```typescript
let result = __<User>(() => userFactory.create('Jack'))
                .map(e => e.name)
                .map(e => e.substr(-1) === 'k')
                .value;

// Result will be true.
console.log(result);
```
